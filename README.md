_______________________________________________
A genetic algorithm developed using PIL in python2.7 which takes in two images as input and morphs one image into another

An example of image morphing is as follows:

input files:

convert the flag of China

into the flag of Burundi

Output:

Dependencies: `PIL`

Run by:

`python GA_flag_morph.py`
